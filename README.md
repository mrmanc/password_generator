# Password Generator Tool

The purpose of this code is to generate a random password.

You can specify the size requirement along with the number of numbers and special characters you want your password to contain.

There is an additional test which finds the original password when a password has been encrypted.

This was taken from exercise 37 from 57 Exercises for programmers by Brian P Hogson.
